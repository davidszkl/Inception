# Inception
System administration project to learn docker, the goal is to create a docker-compose file that will create a network with:
- Nginx https webserver on port 443
- Wordpress + php-fpm on port 9000
- MariaDB on 3306
- Persistent storage for the database and wordpress config / files
The images need to be re-written too.
